                            <h2>Quality food</h2>
                            <p class="lead">
                                Choosing nutritious food and providing good hydration is key to the pet’s well-being. Currently, in the market, there are several kinds of quality food according to their stage of life, whether a puppy, adult, or senior. Buying the right one is one of the recommendations for your pet to be healthy and feel good. However, in some specific cases such as puppies, senior dogs, or those suffering from any intolerance, pathology, or specific food need, it is appropriate to adapt their diet to those specific requirements.

                            <h2> Animal education</h2>
                            <p class="lead">Fundamental for our pet to develop satisfactorily: indicating him where to do his needs, in which spaces, what he can and cannot do, and to guide him from the beginning to instill a good learning process is necessary for a healthy coexistence between his caregivers and the pet. Of course, always from the positive reinforcement, avoiding scolding him sharply or yelling at him, since this way we will only scare him. Likewise, we remind you that this education also implies the interaction of the pet with its environment, socializing with other people and other animals.                        </p>
                            <h2>Hygiene</h2>
                            <p class="lead">There is a lot of controversy about how often a dog should be bathed, the approximate average is once a month. They should also be brushed daily, have their hair and nails trimmed when necessary, and pay attention to the hygiene of their ears and eyes, to avoid the accumulation of dirt and lint.</p>
                            <h2>Walks and physical activity </h2>
                            <p class="lead">Pets need to move and exercise every day. Therefore, you should, especially in the case of dogs, take them for a walk at least three times a day, both to promote their physical activity and to allow them to relieve themselves. Apart from walks, it is also good to play with them at home and keep them active on a regular basis.</p>
                            <h2>Veterinary care and attention</h2>
                            <p class="lead">Although most of the recommendations are within our reach, this is not always the case, so going to the vet is necessary in many cases to check their state of health and intervene with the appropriate treatment, in case of any anomaly. In addition, if you have a dog, you should visit the veterinarian to get the corresponding vaccinations, in case of injury, they could need surgery, also a chip is convenient and, determine an appropriate deworming plan for the animal.
                                How do you take care of your pets? The above mentioned daily cares we have with the pets that are currently in our shelter, some are ready to be adopted, others are in permanent stay, due to age or health complications, but all of them have conditions for a dignified and healthy life.

                            <h2>Select a Veterinarian</h2>
                            <p class="lead">
                                The first step in bringing a cat home is finding a local veterinarian you can trust and communicate with openly. Once you’ve decided, you can reach out to your cat’s veterinarian and set up <b><u>vaccine appointments</u></b>, ask vital questions and get essential tips about how to keep your cat happy and healthy.  
                                A good veterinarian isn’t just there to give your cat their annual checkups. Veterinarians are a wealth of information any time you’re concerned about your cat’s health, behavior or anything else.                          </p>
                            <h2> Feeding & Fresh Water</h2>
                            <p class="lead">Learning how to feed a cat starts with selecting the proper nutrition. Since kittens and adult cats have different nutritional needs, it’s essential to start your cat on an age-appropriate kitten food or adult cat food to make sure they’re getting the right nutrients their body needs to thrive. The amount of food you should feed your cat is usually located on the cat food label itself and is relative to their size and age.  
                                Develop a feeding routine so your cat knows when to expect they’ll eat. If you plan to feed dry cat food, you can put an entire day’s serving in their food dish every morning and let them graze throughout the day. If you give them wet food, it should be consumed within 20 or 30 minutes of serving and any remaining food should be refrigerated and eaten within 24 hours of serving.  </p>
                            <h2>Provide Fresh Water </h2>
                            <p class="lead"> Always keep a supply of clean, fresh water for your cat to help them stay hydrated. Wild cats avoid stagnant water that may be home to harmful bacteria or parasites. As a result, many domesticated cats may instinctively avoid drinking water that hasn’t been replaced, so make sure to replace the water in their bowl daily. Choose a shallow, wide bowl that won’t irritate their whiskers. You can also try a recirculating water fountain. </p>
                            <h2>Familiarize Your Cat With the Litter Box</h2>
                            <p class="lead">Although cats are excellent at grooming themselves, grooming your cat will be necessary from time to time, especially for longhaired breeds. Whether it’s nail trimming, bathing or brushing, make sure you have the right tools on hand to get the job done.  </p>
